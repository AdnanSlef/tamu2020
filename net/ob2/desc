Hey, shoot me over your latest version of the code. I have a simple nc session up, just pass it over when you're ready.

You're using vim, right? You should use it; it'll change your life. I basically depend on it for everything these days!

NOTE: This challenge is two parts. Flag one belongs to mwazoski. Flag two belongs to root.

I know you can't build on your machine -- it's so dumb that IT won't install JDK12 for one of our developers.

Go ahead and fire over a tarfile with the contents of src/main in it on our typical netcat port, I'll compile the test jar so you can run it on your side. I'll make my sources available on http://172.30.0.2:8000 so you can fetch the test jar.
